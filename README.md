## How to Use

1.  **Setup Connectors:** Ensure you have configured the custom connectors (`fa_tdd-20document-20generator`, `fa_5Fzip-20folder-20operations`) and have valid API keys configured for the AI Model API (Gemini) in the `GenerateContentwithAIModel` child flow. Also ensure SharePoint connections are correctly setup.
2.  **Configure SharePoint Folders:**  Define the SharePoint Site URL, Document Library, Solution Upload Folder, and Destination Documentation Folder within the `AutomateSolutionDocGenerationonFileUpload` flow parameters, aligning with your Power Platform environment.
3.  **Upload Solution ZIP:** Upload your Power Automate Desktop solution ZIP file to the designated SharePoint Solution Upload Folder.  *(Future versions will support broader Power Platform solution types.)*
4.  **Automatic Documentation Generation:** The workflow will automatically trigger upon file creation, process the solution, and generate the DOCX documentation and SVG flowcharts in the Destination Documentation Folder.
5.  **Access Documentation:** Open the generated DOCX file from the Destination Documentation Folder in SharePoint to review the technical documentation for your Power Platform solution.

## Scaling

*   **Cloud-Native Architecture:** Built on Power Automate and cloud services, the solution inherently benefits from the scalability of Power automate, suitable for growing Power Platform deployments.
*   **Parallel Processing:** The workflow processes individual desktop flows in parallel, improving efficiency for solutions with multiple flows, and adaptable for scaling with larger Power Platform solutions. Concurrency can be adjusted based on needs and connector limits.
*   **Stateless Design:**  The flows are designed to be stateless, making them easier to scale horizontally to handle increasing documentation demands across the Power Platform.
*   **Connector Limits:** Scalability is influenced by connector throttling limits (SharePoint, API connectors). Optimizations and error handling are in place to manage these limits, crucial for robust Power Platform documentation generation. For very large solutions, adjustments to concurrency and retry policies might be needed.
